That is it for Verdant; it was a fun (and hopefully useful!) personal project to maintain.

It was a good run, goodbye us foreigners 😢

RIP MapleStory x Naver Channeling 2020.

## Usage
Pre-compiled downloads can be found [here](https://github.com/NexerqDev/Verdant/releases). ([프로그램 다운](https://github.com/NexerqDev/Verdant/releases))

**New**: Feel free to check out the [GitHub actions page](https://github.com/NexerqDev/Verdant/actions) for some builds done on GitHub's end (choose latest build and under artifacts), perhaps you may trust those binaries more :).

All you have to do is login to your Naver account, change your Maple ID if you desire, then launch the game! (If you run into troubles such as the terrible CAPTCHAs/other changes on Naver's end, [here is an alternative method you can try to login with](https://github.com/NexerqDev/Verdant/blob/master/other/alternate_login_method.md).)

Note that NGM (Nexon Game Manager) must be installed, and obviously MapleStory must be too for this launcher to function properly! Other than that, enjoy! (You shouldn't need to worry about NGM if you installed MapleStory with the installer; only if you copied the game files from another computer.)

Also, as this program is still definitely a work-in-progress, expect bugs! If you do find any however, please report them at [the issue tracker](https://github.com/NexerqDev/Verdant/issues) or let me know on Discord, that would be most appreciated. I'm not always active on MapleStory, but I'm happy to look into issues and fix them.

If you do find this program useful, please consider leaving it a [star](https://github.com/NexerqDev/Verdant/stargazers)! Thanks!

## Disclaimer
By using this software, you agree that I (Nicholas Tay <nexerq@gmail.com>) and/or collborators am not responsible for any damages that may be caused using this software (account banned, computer went on fire, etc.). That being said, I have tried to the best of my ability to make the program as transparent as possible, and this realistically should not happen. I mean - I use this software to get in and out of my account all the time, so it should be just fine. Basically, all the details can be found in the `LICENSE` file as in the root of the source code repository. Anyways, enjoy and have fun!

If you still don't trust me, you are welcome to look through the entire source code yourself, de/compile binaries, and whatever!

A note for Nexon (넥슨): if you don't like this software, please contact me via email or Twitter instead of banning me or whatever, and I will happily get it resolved ASAP (take down the repo, whatever). Thank you!
